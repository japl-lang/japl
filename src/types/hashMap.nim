# This module implements a very simple (yet hella fast!) associative array.
# Although this module is *meant* to be used for JAPL only, the implementation
# allows for any nim type to be stored in it thanks to the options module. You
# could literally replace nim's tables implementation with this and get identical
# behavior (well, assuming the GC doesn't fuck you up, which it probably will)
